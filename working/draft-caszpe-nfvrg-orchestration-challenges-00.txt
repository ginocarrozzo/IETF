       Network Function Virtualization: Orchestration Challenges
             draft-caszpe-nfvrg-orchestration-challenges-00

Abstract

   Network function virtualization (NFV) promises improved operations in
   terms of flexibility, efficiency, and manageability, but
   orchastration, in general, and recursive orchastration, in
   particular, is still an item of ongoing research.  We summarize the
   current state of the art in open-source initiatives in this area and
   present current directions of research and development in terms of
   orchestation, resource decomposition and federation, policy-based
   resource management, measurement and analytics, and virtual network
   function (VNF) elasticity.

1.  Introduction

   To a large degree there is agreement in the network research,
   practitioner, and standardization communities that rigid network
   control limits the flexibility and manageability of service creation,
   as discussed in [NSC] and the references therein.  Today operators
   run IP networks stiched together by a plethora of highly specialized
   middleboxes that implement firewall, NAT, DPI, traffic scrubbing, and
   other functionality [middlebox].  In this environment orchestration
   is fragmented, hindering rapid service deployment.  Moreover,
   recursive orchestration for heterogeneous resources is not
   practically employed.  In this memo, we examine orchestration support
   in current open-source efforts and decribe research challenges in
   this area.

Internet-Draft        NFV Orchestration Challenges          October 2015


1.1.  Motivation

   Flexible service definition and creation start by formalizing the
   service into the concept of network function forwarding graphs, such
   as the ETSI VNF Forwarding Graph [ETSI-NFV-Arch] or the ongoing work
   in IETF [RFC7498].  These graphs represent the way in which service
   end-points (e.g., customer access) are interconnected with a set of
   selected network functionalities such as firewalls, load balancers,
   and so on, to deliver a network service.  Service graph
   representations form the input for the management and orchestration
   to instantiate and configure the requested service.  For example,
   ETSI defined a Management and Orchestration (MANO) framework in
   [ETSI-NFV-MANO].  We note that throughout such a management and
   orchestration framework different abstractions may appear for
   separation of concerns, roles or functionality, or for information
   hiding.

   In the simplest case, all resources would be part of the same service
   provider domain.  We need to ensure that each entity can be procured
   from a different vendor and therefore interoperability is key for
   multi-vendor NFVI deployment.  Without such interoperability
   different technologies for data center and network operation result
   in distinct technology domains within a single carrier.  Multi-
   technology barriers start to emerge hindering the full
   programmability of the NFVI and limiting the potential for rapid
   service deployment.

   We are also interested in a multi-operation environment, where the
   roles and responsibilities are distributed according to some
   organizational structure within the organization.  Finally, we are
   interested in multi-provider environment, where different
   infrastructure resources are available from different service
   providers (SPs).  We expect that this type of deployments will become
   more common in the future as they are well suited with the elasticity
   and flexibility requirements [NSC].

1.2.  Scope

   In this document we consider the orchestration of heterogeneous
   virtual resources and functions which can, in general, a) be
   programed in a recursive manner, b) be shared based on policies, and
   c) reside across different administrative domains.  This can allow
   defining larger virtual overlays where different resources and
   functions are deployed, combined, and handled in the form of virtual
   instances irrespective of the administrative domain and specific
   technology from which they originate.

Internet-Draft        NFV Orchestration Challenges          October 2015


   Examples of application contexts for recursive orchstration include,
   but are not limited to, the following:

   o  large scale experimentation over programmable networks, based on
      slices of network and compute resources from different federated
      providers;

   o  operators who intend to implement their network service offer over
      virtual infrastructure in the form of virtual network and compute
      resources and functions, all procured as a service from physical
      infrastructure providers.

1.3.  Terminology

   We use the term compute and "compute and storage" interchangeably
   throughout the document.  Moreover, we use the following definitions,
   some of which are established in [ETSI-NFV-Arch] and are copied here
   for reader convenience.

   Network Function Virtualization (NFV)
      The principle of separating network functions from the hardware
      they run on by using virtual hardware abstraction.

   NFV Infrastructure Point of Presence (NFVI PoP)
      Any combination of virtualized compute, storage and network
      resources.

   NFV Infrastructure (NFVI)
      Collection of NFVI PoPs under one orchestrator.

   Virtual Network Function (VNF)
      One or more virtual machines running different software and
      processes on top of industry-standard high-volume servers,
      switches and storage, or cloud computing infrastructure, and
      capable of implementing network functions traditionally
      implemented via custom hardware appliances and middleboxes (e.g.
      router, NAT, firewall, load balancer, etc.)

   Virtualized Network Function Forwarding Graph (VNF FG)
      An ordered list of VNFs creating a service chain.

   VNF Island
      A set of virtualized network functions and related network and
      compute resources under the same administrative ownership/control.
      A VNF island could consist of multiple zones, each characterized
      by a specific set of control tools and interfaces.

   VNF Zone



Carrozzo, et al.         Expires April 30, 2016                 [Page 4]

Internet-Draft        NFV Orchestration Challenges          October 2015


      A set of virtual network functions grouped for homogeneity of
      technologies and/or control tools and/or interfaces (e.g.  L2
      switching zone, optical switching zone, OpenFlow controlled zone,
      other transit domain zone with a control interface).  The major
      goal of defining SDN zones is to implement appropriate policies
      for increasing availability, scalability and control of the
      different resources of the island.  Examples of zone definitions
      are available in popular cloud management systems like CloudStack
      (e.g. refer to the CloudStack Infrastructure partitioning into
      regions, zones, pods, etc., [cloudstack]) and OpenStack (e.g.
      refer to the infrastructure partitioning in availability zones and
      host aggregates [openstack]).

   Transit network domains
      Network domains can use a bandwidth-on-demand interface to expose
      automatically and on-demand control of connectivity services and,
      optionally, inter-domain topology exchange.  In order to federate
      resources of distant facilities (i.e. islands/zones) it must be
      ensured that interconnectivity is provided on-demand and with a
      specific granularity.

   Slice
      A user-defined subset of virtual networking and compute resources,
      created from the physical resources available in federated VNF
      Zones and VNF Islands.  A VNF Slice has the basic property of
      being isolated from other slices defined over the same physical
      resources, and being dynamically extensible across multiple VNF
      Islands.  Each VNF Slice instantiates the specific set of control
      tools of the specific zones it traverses.

   Resource Orchestrator (RO)
      Entity responsible for orchestrating end-to-end network service
      and resources reservation in terms of compute, storage and network
      functions over the infrastructure, as well as delegating end-to-
      end resource and service provisioning in a technology-agnostic
      way.

   Resource Manager (RM)
      Entity responsible for controlling and managing different types of
      resources and/or network functions.

   Management and Orchestration (MANO)
      In the ETSI NFV framework [ETSI-NFV-MANO], MANO is the global
      entity responsible for management and orchestration of NFV
      lifecycle.

   Further, we make use of the following terms:

   NF is a network function, either software-based (VNF) or appliance-
      based.

   SW is a (routing/switching) network element with a programmable
      control plane interface.

   DC is a data center network element which in addition to a
      programmable control plane interface offers a DC control
      interface.

   LS is a logical switch instance.

   CN is an element equipped with compute and/or storage resources.

   UN or universal node, is a network element that integrates and
      manages in a unified platform both compute and networking
      components.

2.  Orchestration Review

2.1.  An Illustrated Example

   Assume that the set of virtual network and non-network functions is
   determined, reserved and deployed across the different islands, the
   resulting virtual network environment is ready for being used by any
   tool or application the user wants to deploy in it.  Figure 1
   illustrates a resource orchestrator (RO) as a functional entity whose
   task is to map the service graph to the infrastructure resources
   under some service constraints and taking into account the NF
   resource descriptions.

   Figure 1: Resource Orchestrator: information base, inputs and output

   NF resource descriptions are assumed to contain information necessary
   to map NF types to a choice of instantiable VNF flavor or a selection
   of an already deployed NF appliance and networking demands for
   different operational policies.  For example, if energy efficiency is
   to be considered during the decision process then information related
   to energy consumption of different NF flavours under different
   conditions (e.g., network load) should be included in the resource
   description.

   Note that we also introduce a new service provider (SP0) which
   effectively operates on top of the virtualized infrastructure offered
   by service providers SP1, SP2 and SP3.

   Figure 2 illustrates Resource Orchestrators (RO) which are
   responsible for orchestrating end-to-end network services and
   resources reservations in the whole infrastructure.  Moreover, ROs
   should be able to delegate end-to-end resource and service
   provisioning in technology-agnostic way.

   ROs are connected to different types of Resource Managers (RMs),which
   are in turn used to control and manage different kinds of
   technological resources.  For example, the RM (WAN) provides

   connectivity between L1/L2 network domains at the two ends.  This
   management can be achieved using frame, packet or circuit switching
   technologies and should support different protocols.

   On the other hand, for instance, the RM (LAN) manages the network
   infrastructure composed of SDN-enabled devices, e.g.  OpenFlow
   switches or routers.  In short, it can control the user traffic
   environment by updating flow tables in physical devices.

   AAA is a cross layer function facilitating authN/authZ procedures in
   federated facilities.  Similarly, monitoring allows to retrieve,
   correlate and abstract statistics from the different components of
   the physical and virtual resources.

              Figure 2: Recursive Orchestration Illustration

   In order for the RO to execute the resource mapping it needs to
   operate on the combined control plane illustrated in Figure 3.  In
   this figure we mark clearly that the interfaces to the compute (DC)
   control plane and the SDN (SW) control plane are distinct and
   implemented through different interfaces/APIs.  For example, Ic1
   could be the Apache CloudStack API, while Ic2 could be a control
   plane protocol such as ForCES or OpenFlow [RFC7426].  In thiscase,

   the orchestrator at SP0 (top part of the figure) needs to maintain a
   tight coordination across this range of interfaces.

2.2.  OpenStack

   Among cloud orchestration solutions, OpenStack is the de facto common
   reference through its Heat module [os-heat].  Openstack Heat
   implements an orchestration engine to launch multiple composite cloud
   applications based on templates in the form of text files that can be
   treated like code.  Many existing CloudFormation templates can be
   launched on OpenStack.  Heat provides both an OpenStack-native REST
   API and a CloudFormation-compatible Query API.

   A Heat template describes the infrastructure for a cloud application
   in a text file.  Infrastructure resources that can be described
   include: servers, floating ips, volumes, security groups, users, etc.
   Templates can also specify the relationships between resources (e.g.

   Heat primarily manages cloud infrastructure, does not support
   federation and AAA is bundled in the OpenStack framework.

2.3.  OpenMANO

   OpenMANO is an open source project which implements the reference
   architecture for Management and Orchestration under standardization
   at ETSI NFV ISG (NFV MANO) [openmano].  OpenMANO consists of two main
   SW components:

   o  NFV VIM (Virtualised Infrastructure Manager) to provide computing
      and networking capabilities and to deploy virtual machines.

   o  A reference implementation of an Network Functions Virtualisation
      Orchestrator (NFV-O), which allows the creation and deletion of
      VNF templates, VNF instances, network service templates and
      network service instances.

   OpenMANO does not support federation and AAA as of today.

2.4.  Federated Experimentation Infrastructures

   The FELIX project implements federation and integration of different
   network and compute resources controlled via SDN and Network Service
   Interface (NSI) in a multi-domain heterogeneous environment across,
   initially spanning Europe and Japan.  The FELIX architecture extends
   and advances assets previously developed (e.g. in OFELIA), by
   realizing the federation concepts defined in SFA [SFA] with a
   combination of recursive and hierarchical orchestration, request
   delegation and inter-domain dependency management.  Further details
   are available in [I-D.felix-nfvrg-recursive-orchestration] and the
   references therein.

3.  Challenges

   Orchestrating networking resources appears to have a recursive nature
   at different levels of the hierarchy.  Would a programmatic interface
   at the combined compute and network abstraction better support this
   recursive and constraint-based resource allocation?  Further, can
   such a joint compute, storage and network programmatic interface
   allow an automated resource orchestration similar to the recursive
   SDN architecture [RFC7426][ONF-SDN-ARCH]?  Below we we summarize key
   questions and challenges which arise from the recursive resource
   orchestration and management concepts.

3.1.  Resource description

   A prerequisite for joint placement decisions of compute, storage and
   network is the adequate description of available resources.  There
   have been manifold attempts to create frameworks for resource
   description, most prominently RDF of W3C, NDL, the GENI RPC and its
   concept of Aggregate Managers, ONF's TTP and many more.  Quite
   naturally, all attempts to standardize "arbitrary" resource
   descriptions lead to creating ontologies, complex graphs describing
   relations of terms to each other.

   Practical descriptions of compute resources are currently focusing on
   number of logical CPU cores, available RAM and storage, allowing,
   e.g., the OpenStack Nova scheduler to meet placement decisions.  In
   heterogeneous network and compute environments, hardware may have
   different acceleration capabilities (e.g., AES-NI or hardware random
   number generators), so the notion of logical compute cores is not
   expressive enough.  In addition, the network interfaces (and link
   load) provide important information on how fast a certain VNF can be
   executed in one node.

   This may lead to a description of resources as VNF-FGs themselves.
   Networking resource (SW) may expose the capability to forward and
   process frames in, e.g., an OpenFlow TableFeatures reply.  Compute
   nodes in the VNF-FG would expose lists of capabilities like the
   presence of AES hardware acceleration, Intel DPDK support, or complex
   functions like a running web server.  An essential part of the
   compute node's capability would be the ability to run a certain VNF
   of type X within a certain QoS spec.  As the QoS is service specific,
   it can only be exposed by a control function within the instantiated
   VNF-FG.

3.2.  Dependencies (de-composition)

   Salt [SALT], Puppet [PUPPET], Chef [CHEF] and Ansible [ANSIBLE] are
   tools to manage large scale installations of virtual machines in DC
   environments.  Essentially, the decomposition of a complex function
   into its dependencies is encoded in "recipes" (Chef).

   The OASIS TOSCA [TOSCA] specification aims at describing application
   layer services to automate interoperable deployment in alternative
   cloud environments.  The TOSCA specification "provides a language to
   describe service components and their relationships using a service
   topology".

   Is there a dependency (decomposition) abstraction suitable to drive
   resource orchestration between application layer descriptions (like
   TOSCA) and cloud specific installations (like Chef recipes)?

3.3.  Elastic VNF

   In many use cases, a VNF may not be designed for scaling up/down, as
   scaling up/down may require a restart of the VNF which the state data
   may be lost.  Normally a VNF may be capable for scaling in/out only.
   Such VNF is designed running on top of a small VM and grouped as a
   pool of one VNF function.  VNF scaling may cross multiple NFVI PoPs
   (or data center)s in order to avoid limitation of the NVFI
   capability.  At cross-DC scaling, the result is that the new VNF
   instance may be placed at a remote cloud location.  At VNF scaling,
   it is a must requirement to provide the same level of Service Level
   Agreement (SLA) including performance, reliability and security.

   In general, a VNF is part of a VNF Forwarding Graph (VNF FG), meaning
   the data traffic may traverse multiple stateful and stateless VNF
   functions in sequence.  When some VNF instances of a given service
   function chain are placed / scaled out in a distant cloud execution,
   the service traffic may have to traverse multiple VNF instances which
   are located in multiple physical locations.  In the worst case, the
   data traffic may ping-pong between multiple physical locations.
   Therefore it is important to take the whole service function chain's
   performance into consideration when placing and scaling one of its
   VNF instance.  Network and cloud resources need mutual
   considerations, see [I-D.zu-nfvrg-elasticity-vnf].

3.4.  Measurement and analytics

   Programmable, dynamic, and elastic VNF deployment requires that the
   Resource Orchestrator (RO) entities obtain timely information about
   the actual operational conditions between different locations where
   VNFs can be placed.  Scaling VNFs in/out/up/down, VNF execution
   migration and VNF mobility, as well as right-sizing the VNFI resource
   allocations is a research area that is expected to grow in the coming
   years as mechanisms, heuristics, and measurement and analytics
   frameworks are developed.

   For example, Veitch et al.  [IAF] point out that NFV deployment will
   "present network operators with significant implementation
   challenges".  They look into the problems arising from the lack of
   proper tools for testing and diagnostics and explore the use of
   embedded instrumentation.  They find that in certain scenarios fine-
   tuning resource allocation based on instrumentation can lead to at
   least 50% reduction in compute provisioning.  In this context, three
   categories emerge where more research is needed.

   First, in the compute domain, performance analysis will need to
   evolve significantly from the current "safety factor" mentality which
   has served well carriers in the dedicated, hardware-based appliances



Carrozzo, et al.         Expires April 30, 2016                [Page 12]

Internet-Draft        NFV Orchestration Challenges          October 2015


   era.  In the emerging softwarized deployments, VNFI will require new
   tools for planning, testing, and reliability assurance.  Meirosu et
   al.  [I-D.unify-nfvrg-devops] describe in detail the challenges in
   this area with respect to verification, testing, troubleshooting and
   observability.

   Second, in the network domain, performance measurement and analysis
   will play a key role in determining the scope and range of VNF
   distribution across the resources available.  For example, IETF has
   worked on the standardization of IP performance metrics for years.
   The Two-Way Active Measurement Protocol (TWAMP) could be employed,
   for instance, to capture the actual operational state of the network
   prior to making RO decisions.  TWAMP management, however, still lacks
   a standardized and programmable management and configuration data
   model [I-D.cmzrjp-ippm-twamp-yang].  We expect that as VNFI
   programmability gathers interest from network carriers several IETF
   protocols will be revisited in order to bring them up to date with
   respect to the current operational requirements.  To this end, NFVRG
   can play an active role in identifying future IETF standardization
   directions.

   Third, non-technical considerations which relate to business aspects
   or priorities need to be modeled and codified so that ROs can take
   intelligent decisions.  Meirosu et al.  [I-D.unify-nfvrg-devops]
   identify two aspects of this problem, namely a) how high-level
   network goals are translated into low-level configuration commands;
   and b) monitoring functions that go beyond measuring simple metrics
   such as delay or packet loss.  Energy efficiency and cost, for
   example, can steer NFV placement.  In NFVI deployments operational
   practices such as follow-the-sun will be considered as earlier
   research in the data center context implies.
