	<abstract>
	<t>The introduction of network and service functionality
	virtualization in carrier-grade networks promises improved
	operations in terms of flexibility, efficiency, and
	manageability. In current practice, virtualization is
	controlled through orchestrator entities that expose
	programmable interfaces according to the underlying resource
	types. Typically this means the adoption of, on the one hand, established data
	center compute/storage and, on the other, network control APIs which were
	originally developed in isolation. Arguably, the possibility
	for innovation highly depends on the capabilities and openness
	of the aforementioned interfaces. This document introduces in
	simple terms the problems arising when one follows this
	approach and motivates the need for a high level of
	programmability beyond policy and service descriptions. This
	document also summarizes the challenges related to
	orchestration programming in this unified cloud and carrier
	network production environment.</t>
    </abstract>

  <middle>
    <section title="Introduction" anchor="intro">

      <t>To a large degree there is agreement in the network research,
	practitioner, and standardization communities that rigid network
	control limits the flexibility and manageability of speedy service
	creation, as discussed in <xref target="NSC" /> and the references
	therein. For instance, it is not unusual that today an average service
	creation time cycle exceeds 90 hours, whereas given the recent advances
	in virtualization and cloudification one would be interested in service
	creation times in the order of minutes
	<xref target="EU-5GPPP-Contract"/> if not seconds.</t>

	<t>Flexible service definition and creation start by
	formalizing the service into the concept of network function
	forwarding graphs, such as the ETSI VNF Forwarding Graph
	<xref target="ETSI-NFV-Arch"/> or the ongoing work in IETF
	<xref target="I-D.ietf-sfc-problem-statement" />. These graphs
	represent the way in which service end-points (e.g.,
	customer access) are interconnected with a set of selected network
	functionalities such as firewalls, load balancers, and so on,
	to deliver a network service. Service graph representations
	form the input for the management and orchestration to
	instantiate and configure the requested service. For example, ETSI defined
	a Management and Orchestration (MANO) framework in
	<xref target="ETSI-NFV-MANO"/>. We note that throughout such a
	management and orchestration framework different abstractions
	may appear for separation of concerns, roles or functionality,
	or for information hiding.</t>

    <t>Compute virtualization is central to the concept of Network Function
      Virtualization (NFV).  However, carrier-grade services demand that all
      components of the data path, such as Network Functions (NFs), virtual NFs
      (VNFs) and virtual links, meet key performance requirements.  In this
      context, the inclusion of Data Center (DC) platforms, such as OpenStack
      <xref target="openstack"/>, into the SDN infrastructure is far from
      trivial.</t>

	<t>In this document we examine the problems arising as one
	combines these two formerly isolated environments in an effort
	to create a unified production environment and discuss the
	associated emerging challenges. Our goal is the definition of
	a production environment that allows multi-vendor and
	multi-domain operation based on open and interoperable
	implementations of the key entities described in the remainder
	of this document.</t>

	</section>

    <section title="Terms and Definitions" anchor="terms">

    <t>We use the term compute and "compute and storage"
      interchangeably throughout the document. Moreover, we use the

    <section anchor="motivation" title="Motivations">

    <t><xref target="fig_service_graph"/> illustrates a simple service
    graph comprising three network functions (NFs).  For the sake of
    simplicity, we will assume only two types of infrastructure
    resources, namely SWs and DCs as per the terminology introduced
    above, and ignore appliance-based NFs for the time being.  The
    goal is to implement the given service based on the available
    infrastructure resources.</t>

	<t>The service graph definition contains NF types (NF1, NF2, NF3) along with the

	<list style="symbols">
		<t>corresponding ports (NF1:{2,3}; NF2:{4,5}; NF3:{6,7})</t>
		<t>service access points {1,8} corresponding to infrastructure resources,</t>
		<t>definition of forwarding behavior (fr1, fr2, fr3)</t>
	</list>

	The forwarding behavior contains classifications for matching
	of traffic flows and corresponding outbound forwarding
	actions.</t>

	<t>Assume now that we would like to use the infrastructure
	(topology, network and software resources) depicted in
	<xref target="fig_infrastructure"/> and
	<xref target="fig_pop-dc"/> to implement the aforementioned
	service graph. That is, we have three SWs and two Points of
	Presence (PoPs) with DC software resources at our
	disposal.</t>

	<t>In the simplest case, all resources would be part of the same
	  service provider (SP) domain. We need to ensure that each entity in
	  <xref target="fig_infrastructure"/> can be procured from a different
	  vendor and therefore interoperability is key for multi-vendor NFVI
	  deployment. Without such interoperability different technologies for
	  data center and network operation result in distinct technology
	  domains within a single carrier. Multi-technology barriers start to
	  emerge hindering the full programmability of the NFVI and limiting
	  the potential for rapid service deployment.</t>

	<t>We are also interested in a multi-operation environment, where the
	  roles and responsibilities are distributed according to some
	  organizational structure within the organization. Finally, we are
	  interested in multi-provider environment, where different
	  infrastructure resources are available from different service
	  providers (SPs). <xref target="fig_infrastructure"/> indicates a
	  multi-provider environment in the lower part of the figure as an
	  example.  We expect that this type of deployments will become more
	  common in the future as they are well suited with the elasticity and
	  flexibility requirements <xref target="NSC" />.</t>


	<t><xref target="fig_infrastructure"/> also shows the service access
	  points corresponding to the overarching domain view, i.e., {1,8}. In
	  order to deploy the service graph of
	  <xref target="fig_service_graph"/> on the infrastructure resources of
	  <xref target="fig_infrastructure"/>, we will need an appropriate
	  mapping which can be implemented in practice.</t>

	<t><xref target="fig_pop-dc"/> shows the structure of a PoP DC that
	  presents compute and network resources while <xref target="fig:un"/>
	  shows the structure of the Universal Node (UN), an innovative element
	  that integrates on the same platform both compute and networking
	  components and that could be used in the infrastructure as an
	  alternative to elements depicted in
	  <xref target="fig_infrastructure"/> for what concerns network and/or
	  compute resources.</t>

	<t>In <xref target="fig_ro-mapping"/> we illustrate a resource
	  orchestrator (RO) as a functional entity whose task is to map the
	  service graph to the infrastructure resources under some service
	  constraints and taking into account the NF resource descriptions.</t>

	<t>NF resource descriptions are assumed to contain information
	necessary to map NF types to a choice of instantiable VNF
	flavor or a selection of an already deployed NF appliance and
	networking demands for different operational policies. For
	example, if energy efficiency is to be considered during the
	decision process then information related to energy
	consumption of different NF flavors under different conditions
	(e.g., network load) should be included in the resource
	description.</t>

	<t>Note that we also introduce a new service provider (SP0)
	which effectively operates on top of the virtualized
	infrastructure offered by SP1, SP2 and SP3.</t>

	<t>In order for the RO to execute the resource mapping (which
	in general is a hard problem) it needs to operate on the
	combined control plane illustrated in
	<xref target="fig_ro-ctrls"/>. In this figure we mark clearly
	that the interfaces to the compute (DC) control plane and the
	SDN (SW) control plane are distinct and implemented through
	different interfaces/APIs. For example, Ic1 could be the
	Apache CloudStack API, while Ic2 could be a control plane
	protocol such as ForCES or OpenFlow
	<xref target="RFC7426" />. In this
	case, the orchestrator at SP0 (top part of the figure) needs
	to maintain a tight coordination across this range of
	interfaces.</t>

	<t>In the real-world, however, orchestration operations do not
	stop, for example, at the DC1 level as depicted in
	<xref target="fig_ro-ctrls"/>. If we (so-to-speak) "zoom into"
	DC1 we will see a similar pattern and the need to coordinate
	SW and DC resources within DC1 as illustrated in
	<xref target="fig_dc"/>. As depicted, this edge PoP includes
	compute nodes (CNs) and SWs which in most of the cases will
	also contain an internal topology.</t>

	<t>In <xref target="fig_dc"/>, IcA is an interface similar to
	Ic2 in <xref target="fig_ro-ctrls"/>, while IcB could be, for
	example, OpenStack Nova or similar. The Northbound Interface
	(NBI) to the Compute Controller can use Ic1 or Ic3 as shown in
	<xref target="fig_ro-ctrls"/>.</t>

  <t>In turn, each single Compute Node (CN) may also have
  internal switching resources (see <xref target="fig_cn"/>). In a

<section anchor="problem" title="Problem Statement">

  <t>The motivational examples of <xref target="motivation" /> illustrate that
     almost always compute virtualization and network virtualization are
     tightly connected.  In particular Figure, 3 shows that in a PoP DC there
     are not only compute resources (CNs) but also network resources (SWs), and
     so it illustrates that compute virtualization implicitly involves network
     virtualization unless we consider the unlikely scenario where dedicated
     network elements are used to interconnect the different virtual network
     functions implemented on the compute nodes (e.g.: to implement Flexible
     Service Chaining).  On the other hand, considering a network scenario made
     not only of just pure SDN network elements (SWs) but also of compute
     resources (CNs) or SDN network nodes that are equipped also with compute
     resources (UNs), it is very likely that virtualized network resources, if
     offered to clients, imply virtualization of compute resources, unless we
     consider the unlikely scenario where dedicated compute resources are
     available for every virtualized network.</t>

  <t>Furthermore, virtualization often leads to scenarios of recursions with
    clients redefining and reselling resources and services at different
    levels.</t>

  <t> We argue that given the multi-level virtualization of compute, storage
   and network domains, automation of the corresponding resource provisioning
   could be more easily implemented by a recursive programmatic
   interface. Existing separated compute and network programming interfaces
   cannot easily provide such recursions and cannot always satisfy key
   requirement for multi-vendor, multi-technology and multi-provider
   interoperability environments. Therefore we foresee the necessity of a
   recursive programmatic interface for joint compute, storage and network
   provisioning.</t>

</section>

<section anchor="sec-challenges" title="Challenges">

  <t>We summarize in this section the key questions and challenges,
   which we hope will initiate further discussions in the NFVRG
   community.</t>


  <section anchor="sec:chal-orch" title="Orchestration">
    <t>Firstly, as motivated in <xref target="motivation"/>,
      orchestrating networking resources appears to have a recursive
      nature at different levels of the hierarchy.  Would a
      programmatic interface at the combined compute and network
      abstraction better support this recursive and constraint-based
      resource allocation?
    </t>

    <t>Secondly, can such a joint compute, storage and network
      programmatic interface allow an automated resource orchestration
      similar to the recursive SDN architecture
      <xref target="ONF-SDN-ARCH"/>?
    </t>
  </section>


  <section anchor="sec:chal-res-descr" title="Resource description">
   <t>Prerequisite for joint placement decisions of compute, storage
   and network is the adequate description of available
   resources. This means that the interfaces (IcA, IcB etc. in
   <xref target="fig_ro-ctrls"/> and <xref target="fig_dc"/>) are of
   bidirectional nature, exposing resources as well as reserving.
   There have been manifold attempts to create frameworks for resource
   description, most prominently RDF of W3C, NDL, the GENI RPC and its
   concept of Aggregate Managers, ONF's TTP and many more.</t>

   <t>Quite naturally, all attempts to standardize "arbitrary" resource 
   descriptions lead to creating ontologies, complex graphs describing 
   relations of terms to each other.</t>
   
   <t>Practical descriptions of compute resources are currently focusing on
   number of logical CPU cores, available RAM and storage, allowing, 
   e.g., the OpenStack Nova scheduler to meet placement decisions. 
   In heterogeneous network and compute environments, hardware may have 
   different acceleration capabilities (e.g., AES-NI or hardware random 
   number generators), so the notion of logical compute cores is not 
   expressive enough. In addition, the network interfaces (and link load)
   provide important information on how fast a certain VNF can be 
   executed in one node.</t>

   <t>This may lead to a description of resources as VNF-FGs themselves.
   Networking resource (SW) may expose the capability to forward and 
   process frames in, e.g., OpenFlow TableFeatures reply. Compute nodes 
   in the VNF-FG would expose lists of capabilities like the presence of 
   AES  hardware acceleration, Intel DPDK support, or complex functions 
   like a running web server. An essential part of the compute node's 
   capability would be the ability to run a certain VNF of type X within 
   a certain QoS spec. As the QoS is service specific, it can only be 
   exposed by a control function within the instantiated VNF-FG.</t>

  </section> <!-- resource description  -->

  <section anchor="sec:chal-dependencies" title="Dependencies (de-composition)">
   <t>Salt <xref target="SALT"/>, Puppet <xref target="PUPPET"/>, Chef
   <xref target="CHEF"/> and Ansible <xref target="ANSIBLE"/> are
   tools to manage large scale installations of virtual machines in DC
   environments. Essentially, the decomposition of a complex function
   into its dependencies is encoded in "recipes" (Chef).</t>
   
   <t>OASIS TOSCA <xref target="TOSCA"/> specification aims at
   describing application layer services to automate interoperable
   deployment in alternative cloud environments. The TOSCA
   specification "provides a language to describe service components
   and their relationships using a service topology".</t>

   <t>Is there a dependency (decomposition) abstraction suitable to
   drive resource orchestration between application layer descriptions
   (like TOSCA) and cloud specific installations (like Chef
   recipes)?</t>

  </section>

  <section anchor="sec:chal-elastic-VNF" title="Elastic VNF">
    <t>In many use cases, a VNF may not be designed for scaling
      up/down, as scaling up/down may require a restart of the VNF
      which the state data may be lost. Normally a VNF may be capable
      for scaling in/out only. Such VNF is designed running on top of
      a small VM and grouped as a pool of one VNF function. VNF
      scaling may crossing multiple NFVI PoPs (or data center)s in
      order to avoid limitation of the NVFI capability. At cross DC
      scaling, the result is that the new VNF instance may be placed
      at a remote cloud location. At VNF scaling, it is a must
      requirement to provide the same level of Service Level Agreement
      (SLA) including performance, reliability and security.</t>

    <t>In general, a VNF is part of a VNF Forwarding Graph (VNF FG),
      meaning the data traffic may traverse multiple stateful and
      stateless VNF functions in sequence. When some VNF instances of
      a given service function chain are placed / scaled out in a
      distant cloud execution, the service traffic may have to
      traverse multiple VNF instances which are located in multiple
      physical locations. In the worst case, the data traffic may
      ping-pong between multiple physical locations.  Therefore it is
      important to take the whole service function chain’s performance
      into consideration when placing and scaling one of its VNF
      instance. Network and cloud resources need mutual
      considerations, see
      <xref target="I-D.zu-nfvrg-elasticity-vnf"/>.</t>

    </section> <!-- Elastic VNF -->
    
    <section anchor="sec:chal-measurement" title="Measurement and analytics">
    <t>Programmable, dynamic, and elastic VNF deployment requires that
    the Resource Orchestrator (RO) entities obtain timely information
    about the actual operational conditions between different
    locations where VNFs can be placed. Scaling VNFs in/out/up/down,
    VNF execution migration and VNF mobility, as well as right-sizing
    the VNFI resource allocations is a research area that is expected
    to grow in the coming years as mechanisms, heuristics, and
    measurement and analytics frameworks are developed.</t>

    <t>For example, Veitch et al. <xref target="IAF"/> point out that NFV deployment
    will "present network operators with significant implementation
    challenges". They look into the problems arising from the lack of
    proper tools for testing and diagnostics and explore the use of
    embedded instrumentation. They find that in certain scenarios
    fine-tuning resource allocation based on instrumentation can lead
    to at least 50% reduction in compute provisioning. In this
    context, three categories emerge where more research is
    needed.</t>

    <t>First, in the compute domain, performance analysis will need to evolve
    significantly from the current "safety factor" mentality which has served
    well carriers in the dedicated, hardware-based appliances era. In the
    emerging softwarized deployments, VNFI will require new tools for planning,
    testing, and reliability assurance. Meirosu et
    al. <xref target="I-D.unify-nfvrg-devops" /> describe in detail the
    challenges in this area with respect to verification, testing,
    troubleshooting and observability.</t>

    <t>Second, in the network domain, performance measurement and analysis will
    play a key role in determining the scope and range of VNF distribution
    across the resources available. For example, IETF has worked on the
    standardization of IP performance metrics for years. The Two-Way Active
    Measurement Protocol (TWAMP) could be employed, for instance, to capture
    the actual operational state of the network prior to making RO
    decisions. TWAMP management, however, still lacks a standardized and
    programmable management and configuration data model
    <xref target="I-D.cmzrjp-ippm-twamp-yang" />. We expect that as VNFI
    programmability gathers interest from network carriers several IETF
    protocols will be revisited in order to bring them up to date with respect
    to the current operational requirements. To this end, NFVRG can play an
    active role in identifying future IETF standardization directions.</t>

    <t>Third, non-technical considerations which relate to business aspects or
    priorities need to be modeled and codified so that ROs can take intelligent
    decisions.  Meirosu et al. <xref target="I-D.unify-nfvrg-devops" />
    identify two aspects of this problem, namely a) how high-level network
    goals are translated into low-level configuration commands; and b)
    monitoring functions that go beyond measuring simple metrics such as delay
    or packet loss. Energy efficiency and cost, for example, can steer NFV
    placement. In NFVI deployments operational practices such as follow-the-sun
    will be considered as earlier research in the data center context
    implies.</t>
